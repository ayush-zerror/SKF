          The trouble begins when politician Shashikant Bhide announces that all
          stray dogs will be caught and killed unless societies submit a No
          Objection Certificate (NOC). This puts Bhidu’s life at risk, and the
          kids launch a campaign across the colony to save him. They go
          door-to-door, trying to convince adults, but fall short of the votes
          needed. In a desperate move, the children stage an underwear march, grabbing
          media attention and public sympathy. Their bold act sparks
          conversation and support, but it still isn’t enough to overturn
          Bhide’s rule.</p>
