          The trouble begins when politician Shashikant Bhide announces that all
          stray dogs will be caught and killed unless societies submit a No
          Objection Certificate (NOC). This puts Bhidu’s life at risk, and the
          kids launch a campaign across the colony to save him. They go
          door-to-door, trying to convince adults, but fall short of the votes
          needed.

          In a desperate move, the children stage an underwear march, grabbing
          media attention and public sympathy. Their bold act sparks
          conversation and support, but it still isn’t enough to overturn
          Bhide’s rule.

          Their final chance comes in a televised debate, where the kids’
          honesty and innocence win over the audience. Inspired, society
          secretary Mr. Tandon changes his stance, and Bhidu is finally accepted
          into the colony — proving that courage and truth can triumph over
          prejudice.
